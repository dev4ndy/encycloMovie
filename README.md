This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.5.

This project is a sample of the use of the framework Angular 6, which is implemented in order to show the knowledge gained in the "Angular" course dictated by AlertLogic company. Here are some relevant points about the project which can demonstrate in a practical way the learned.

* Application of the interfaces to complete the JSON responses that come from the API, in order to facilitate the creation of the objects.
* Application of the use of models or types, to cast the interface on an object of some kind. (movie, tv show, people, video, seasons)
* Application of class inheritance. (TV Shows and seasons).
* Creation of a global service to share generic methods.
* Creation of constants file.
* Use of the routes module
* Use of Angular Material.
* Use of Flex-Layout.
* Comments on most functions.
* Custom theme.
* Passing messages between components.
